# N-body simulations

A few simple [N-body simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation) built using [Simple 2D](https://github.com/simple2d/simple2d) and [Ruby 2D](http://www.ruby2d.com).

`nbody.c` and `nbody.rb` represents celestial bodies with varying masses, all attracted to each other. Run using `make` and `ruby nbody.rb`, respectively. [Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAPHGg87OxA) of it in action.

`nbody_single.c` and `nbody_single.rb` represents celestial bodies with equal masses and attraction to only a single point, the mouse cursor. Run using `make single` and `ruby nbody_single.rb`, respectively. [Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY2SWmcjVnQ) of it in action.
